# Saint Prime

Saint Prime is a gesture-controlled intelligence system inspired by futuristic holographic interfaces. It uses real-time hand tracking to allow users to interact with a digital canvas and HUD widgets through physical movements.

## Features

- Hand Tracking: Real-time 21-landmark hand detection using MediaPipe.
- Gesture Drawing: Draw glowing holographic paths using your index finger.
- Organic Life Engine: Bring drawings to life with parasitic and organism-like movement patterns that roam the screen.
- Precision Pinch Zoom: Zoom into the holographic workspace using a dynamic pinch gesture in open space.
- Widget Interaction: Physically grab and reposition HUD widgets using pinch gestures.
- Stark-Inspired UI: High-fidelity glassmorphism, animated background data rings, and circuit patterns.

## Controls

- Draw: Extend index finger.
- Grab Widget: Pinch thumb and index finger over a widget.
- Zoom: Pinch thumb and index finger in empty space and move them apart or closer.
- Trigger Life: Make a fist and then open it to initiate the biological life cycle of your drawings.
- Terminate Life: Use the dedicated button in the Bio Engine widget to end all persistent animations.

## Technical Stack
